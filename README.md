# Introduction to Front-End State Management

This repository is used to demonstrate state management in React using Redux. Each branch is a different refactor of the project. The master branch relies on local component state while other branchs gradually build a global state tree:
1. `with-reducers`
2. `with-redux`
3. `with-redux-refactor`

## What problem does state management solve?

---

## Problem:
- How do we verify if our state is valid?
- How do we know when/where our state is changing?
- How do we test front-end state?

---

### Solution: Predictable and repeatable state
- Avoid invalid states
- Track changes in state
- Makes testing and debugging easier
